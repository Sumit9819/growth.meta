# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website built with Next.js and Firebase. It includes a public-facing site to showcase services and projects, and an admin panel for managing the content.

## Features Implemented

### Admin Panel

*   **Authentication:** The admin panel is protected and requires authentication to access.
*   **Services Management (CRUD):**
    *   **List Services:** View a list of all services with their title, description, and order.
    *   **Create Service:** Add a new service with a title, description, icon, and order.
    *   **Edit Service:** Update the details of an existing service.
    *   **Delete Service:** Remove a service from the list.
*   **Projects Management (CRUD):**
    *   **List Projects:** View a list of all projects with their title, description, image URL and project URL.
    *   **Create Project:** Add a new project with a title, description, image URL and project URL.
    *   **Edit Project:** Update the details of an existing project.
    *   **Delete Project:** Remove a project from the list.

### Design

*   **Styling:** The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Layout:** The admin panel has a sidebar for navigation and a main content area.
*   **Color Scheme:** The site uses a dark theme with a gray background and blue accents.

## Current Plan

*   The next step is to build the public-facing website that will display the services and projects managed in the admin panel.
